﻿Cafe / Restaurant Order Management System
Project Description
This project is a C# desktop application developed to simulate a simple café/restaurant order management system.
The main goal of the project is to practice object-oriented programming concepts and graphical user interface development using C#.

The application manages real-life objects such as products, customers, and orders.
Users can add products and customers, create orders by selecting products and quantities, and calculate the total price of an order through the graphical user interface.



Model Classes

The project includes the following main model classes, each defined in a separate file:

Product: Represents items sold in the café (name, price).

Customer: Represents customers placing orders (name, phone number).

Order: Represents an order created for a customer.

OrderItem: Represents individual items in an order with quantity and total price calculation.



Application Features

Add new products with price validation

Add new customers

List products and customers

Create orders by selecting a customer, product, and quantity

Calculate and display the total price of an order

All operations are performed through class methods rather than hardcoded values, simulating real-world application behavior.





Full-Scale vs Current Implementation
Intended Full-Scale Application

In a full-scale version, the application could include:

Multiple orders per customer

Payment tracking

Order history

Data persistence using a database

Current Implementation (Submitted Version)

The submitted version focuses on:

Managing products and customers

Creating orders and calculating total prices

Demonstrating object-oriented design and GUI interaction

This scope is intentionally limited to meet course requirements and testing purposes.




Technologies Used

C#

Windows Forms (WinForms)

.NET Framework




How to Run the Application

Open the project in Visual Studio

Build the solution

Run the application using F5

Use the graphical interface to add products, customers, and create orders
